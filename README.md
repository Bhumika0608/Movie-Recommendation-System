# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project implements a comprehensive movie recommendation system using the **MovieLens 100k dataset**. The system combines **user-based collaborative filtering**, **item-based collaborative filtering**, and **content-based filtering** to recommend movies to users based on ratings, similar users, and movie genres.
